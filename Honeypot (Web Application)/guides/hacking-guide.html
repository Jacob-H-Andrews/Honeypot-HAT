		<p><b>Introduction</b></br>
			First of all, let's all accept that saying 'a Career in Cybersecurity' is a little like saying 'a Career in Finance,' that is, it's a paragliding word that combines hundreds of niches inside the industry. For eg, in cybersecurity we will think about digital forensics as a profession, or detecting, auditing, pentesting, social engineering and several more profession tracks for malware / software.</br></br>

            If you have no experience <b>don’t worry</b>. We ALL had to start somewhere, so to get where we are now, we ALL needed support. Nobody is an island and nobody is born with all the skills required. And you have zero knowledge and minimal skills - my suggestion in this case is to introduce those total basics to yourself. </br></br></br>

            <b>1. What is hacking?</b></br>
            Hacking is distinguishing shortcoming and vulnerabilities of some framework and obtaining entrances with it.</br></br>
			
			A programmer gets unapproved access by focusing on framework while moral programmer has an official authorization in a legal and authentic way to survey the security stance of an objective system.</br></br></br>

			<b>2. Skills required to become a hacker</b></br>
			Above all else to be a Pentester you should be eager to constantly learn new things on the fly and additionally rapidly at home. Furthermore, you have to have a solid essential comprehension of in any event one coding/scripting language just as a comprehension of Network and Web Security.</br></br></br>

			So here are some steps if you want to start from now…

			<ul>
	    		<li>Learn To Code (Programming).</li>
	    		<li>Understand basic concepts of Operating System</li>
	    		<li>Fundamentals of Networking and Security</li>
	    		<li>Markup and as many technologies as you can</li>
			</ul></br>

			<b>3. What platform should I code in?</b></br>
			For web applications, I suggest you learn HTML, PHP, JSP, and ASP. For mobile applications, Java (Android), Swift (iOS), C# (Windows Phone). For desktop-based software try Python, Java, C#, C++.</br></br>

			Be that as it may, what truly is essential for each programming language is to gain proficiency with the basics of programming, ideas like the information types, the variable control all through the program at the OS level to the utilization of subroutines otherwise known as capacities, etc. In the event that you get familiar with these, it's essentially the equivalent for each programming language aside from some structure changes.</br></br>
